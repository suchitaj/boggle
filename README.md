# boggle
boggle game player

- Generates a 4x4 game board for the player
- Asks the player to enter a word, checks that the word is valid in a dictionary and is a valid word on the displayed board.
- Keeps track of user's scores
- Exits after displaying longest possible word for that board layout.

Limitations:
- Board generation is hard coded for a 4x4 board, but that part should not be too hard to generalize.
